## Introduction
For the last task of this program, the Capstone Project, I decided to carry out the project “Optimizing Application Offers with Starbucks”,
the challenge is to create a more efficient model for sending offers, the goal is to send offers to the company's most profitable customers and not to everyone. Thus, the intention is to increase revenue and reduce costs.

The development of the analysis, the decisions I made and the results are shown in a Jupyter notebook.
My focus is to analyze the less profitable offers that were sent to the wrong customers, in my view.

## Questions
The questions I want to resolve are:
1. financial losses caused by “unnecessary supply”?
2. What are the main characteristics of the customer who completed the offer without viewing it?
3. How is the income between different types of customers?

## Conclusion
The main conclusions are:

1. If there is no plan to send the offer, you can lose up to $ 49K of revenue in one month or $ 588K of revenue in one year. Therefore, the direct sending of offers is very important and can avoid considerable losses of money.
2. Women spend more than men, with an average ticket of $ 16 and $ 10 respectively. They usually complete the offer, even without seeing it in advance. A more accurate filtering process will be more advantageous when sending offers to women.
3. Most of the time, customers with higher average income complete the offer without viewing it in advance, often in the discount offer, those who do not see the offer in advance have a 71K income and those who viewed it have a $ 67K income.

## Recommendation and Future Improvements
Based on this analysis of these data, my suggestions are:

1.Cancellation or revision of the BOGO offer strategy that generates a loss of $ 31K. It is possible to infer that a considerable part of customers who consume more than two cups would already buy the same quantity of products even without any discount.
2. It is not prejudice but considering the company's financial health we should send less discounts to women. Most of them will probably buy our products anyway. On average they spend $ 16, if you send $ 10 off, our loss will be huge. It would be better to take actions to increase the minimum female spending, there is a possibility of an increase of 25% to 50%, in other words, from $ 20 to $ 24.
3. Robin'n Wood approach, based on the level of income of each client. To the point: More discount for the poorest, less discount for the richest. Bernie Sanders spinning happy
